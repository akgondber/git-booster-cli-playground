In this post I am going to explore a CLI app that can bring your git experience to the new level.

It is npm package and needs to be installed globally using your preferred package manager:
`npm install -g git-booster-cli`
or
`yarn global add git-booster-cli`
etc.

When we have installed the utility, we can show the capabilities that it provides, you can issue .
```
git-booster-cli
#or
gbst
#or
gbcli
```
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added emoji support"`
$ git push origin main
```

Using git-booster-cli you can do it at one pass, what you need
